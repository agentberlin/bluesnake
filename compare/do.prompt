I have a script compare/compare_crawlers.py in this directory that will run screamingfrog and bluesnake (this project) for a given domain and will print the stats to the terminal. You need to look at the diff and pick one most important issue to be worked up on and fix it. Note that the output files may have a lot of content in it, be smart to read it in chunks or something.

- You don't need to read compare_crawlers.py file unless you feel compelled to do so
- You don't need to read historical diff comparisions because that can get very context intensive

Run the script with the command to generate a new report. Always generate a new report, instead of looking at past reports.

```bash
uv run compare/compare_crawlers.py <domain>
```

Ask for the domain if not provided already

Do whatever it takes to get to the fix.
